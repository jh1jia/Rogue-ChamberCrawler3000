A game of CC3k consists of a board 79 columns wide and 30 rows high (5 rows are reserved for displaying information). 

Game play is as follows: the player character moves through a dungeon and slays enemies and collects treasure until reaching the end of the dungeon (where the end of the dungeon is the 5th floor). In order to run this game, you need to run it on a UNIX based terminal.

Upon cloning the repository, type the command: "make" to compile the code. Once compiled, you can run the game by executing the executable: ./cc3k
